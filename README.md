# Data Analysis with Python (Jupyter Notebook)

This is my assignments for Data Analysis with Python course I started before I wrote my masters' research paper Python code. I used Google Colab, and the assignments covers EDA, data cleaning, data visualization, simple regressions (OLS, time series, logistic regression), and intro to Machine Learning. Previously, I mostly use Stata and Excel for my data analysis work... or sometimes R. Since I realized that I need to learn Python for my research paper so I study how to code in Python during Spring and early summer of 2025. Turns out, this is really useful for my research paper (and I think, my future works too). :)

## Outputs
* Lab 1 — Python warm-up + basic EDA
* Lab 2 — Data cleaning, joining, quick summaries
* Lab 3 — Visualization (exploratory plots) and simple regressions (OLS)
* Lab 4 — Time series regressions
* Lab 5 — Intro ML (train/test, basic models, Random Forest Model)
* Lab 6 — LPM and logistic regressions

## Datasets used
* Lab 1 — Working from Home Dataset from [Gabors Data Analysis](https://gabors-data-analysis.com/datasets/#working-from-home)
* Lab 2-3, 5-6 — The Quality of Government (Cross-section data) from [University of Gothenburg](https://www.gu.se/en/quality-government/qog-data/data-downloads/basic-dataset)
* Lab 4 — Real GDP (Gross Domestic Product) and Real GFCF (Gross Fixed Capital Formation) data from [The Fed St. Louis](https://fred.stlouisfed.org/)
